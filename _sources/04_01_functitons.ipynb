    "<b>Functions</b> exist in all programming languages. They allow you to write a set of code that can be used later in your program. They are essential because they allow you to not rewrite the same block of text over and over again. Good code is code that does not repeat. In other words, if your program has a task that it needs to do repetitively, then you should develop that code into a cleaned function.\n",
