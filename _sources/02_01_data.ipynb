    "Unlike integers and floats, strings are a sequence of characters. These can be digits or they can be letters or symbols, but what makes a string distinctly different from an integer or a float is the presence of quotation marks, i.e. ” ” or ‘ ‘. The opening of a quotation mark indicates to Python that a string has begun and the closing of the same style of a quotation mark indicates the close of a string. It is important to use the same style of quotation mark for a string, either a double or a single. In the examples below, we have two string objects: a_string and b_string, the former corresponds to the string “Hello” and the latter corresponds to the string “Bye”."

A float, on the other hand, is a digit with a decimal place. So, while 1 is an integer, 1.0 is a float. Floats, like integers, can be of any size, but they necessarily have a decimal place, i.e. 200.0020002938. In python, you do not need any special characters to create an integer or float object. You simply need an equal sign. In the example below, we have two objects which are created with a single equal sign.

    "They are the key way in which we handle text data in Python. This means that for the digital humanist, strings will be fundamentally necessary to understand as they are the chief form of data we use.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to interact with strings as pieces of data, we use methods and functions. The chief functions for interacting with strings on a basic level come standard with Python. This means that you do not need to install third-party libraries. Later in this textbook we will do more advanced things with strings using third-party libraries, such as Regex, but for now, we will simply work with the basic functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although I will discuss functions in greater detail in a later lesson, it is important to understand what a function is. A function is a block of code stored outside (or inside) your Python script. We call a function by using the function name and added an open and a close parentheses. Often when we call functions, we need to pass arguments. These are the pieces of data that the function will perform the operations on. The arguments are contained within the parentheses and delineated with commas. In some cases, there will be named arguments which require you to specify a specific argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, we have an object, which is a string (a_string), and two different functions. The first function is the split function which will split a string. In the example we state the object upon which we want to perform the function. Next, we place a period to state the specific function that we want to run on the string. We have an open parentheses in which we have a single argument, a string (created by quotation marks). The specific string is a single comma. This means that we are telling Python to split the string any time it finds a comma. Remember though, strings are immutable. This means that in order to store the result of this function in memory, we need to create a new object. This new object is new_string which we create with an equal sign. Were we to print off new string, we would see a list of strings that would look like this: [“Hello”,”Bye”]. To run the code below, hit the play button."
