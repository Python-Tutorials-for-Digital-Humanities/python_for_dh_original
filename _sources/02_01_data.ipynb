    "- floats\n",

    "As digital humanists, you might be thinking to yourself, “I just work with text, why should I care so much about numbers?” The answer? Numbers allow us to perform quantitative analysis. What if you want to know the times a specific author wrote to a colleague or to which places he wrote most frequently, as was the case with the Republic of Letters project at Stanford? In order to perform that kind of analysis, you MUST have a command of how numbers work in Python, how to perform basic mathematical functions on those numbers, and how to interact with them. Further, numbers are essential to understand for performing more advanced functions in Python, such as Loops, explored in Chapter 03.01.\n",
