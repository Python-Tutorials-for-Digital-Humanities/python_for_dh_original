This repository holds my forthcoming JupyterBook, Introduction to Python for DH. It is meant to function as a quick introduction to Pandas for non-specialists, or those new to Python. It presumes that the reader has no knowledge of the basic data structures in Python, e.g. lists, dictionaries, etc. It also presumes that you have no understanding of Python objects. Below is the tentative table of contents. It will be completed in February 2022.
