# INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON FOR BEGINNERS
This course is an introduction to Python. It presumes no knowledge on the part of the viewer. I presume that you do not have any prior knowledge about programming in general or knowledge of data. This repo goes along with my 3-hour video on Python. If you watch the video in its entirety and follow along with the lessons at Python-Textbook.PythonHumanities.com, then you will be in a good position to begin working with Python on your own projects.

While this course was originally designed for humanists, it is equally valuable to anyone who is interested in getting started with Python. Below, you will find an outline for the course. Within this repo are Jupyter Notebooks. Each notebook correspondsd to a specific lesson.
